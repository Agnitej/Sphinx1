Tables
=======
.. You can add reStructured Text table syntax with .. list-table:: directive.
    For proper formatting, the asterisk indicating each row must align vertically, 
    and the hyphens indicating each column must also align. 
    Empty cells must be accounted for, so that each column in a row is always marked, 
    even if there is no content in the table cell. 

.. list-table:: Food
