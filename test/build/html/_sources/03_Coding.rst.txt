Coding part
========================

Here I will be writing a code

.. The codes must be followed by "::" to tell sphinx tat the following is a code
   if you want to specify which language one is writing then youcan use code-block as shown below
   This helps the sphinx to know the language and to highlight the code in the html page

A cool bit of code:
 .. code-block:: python

   print("hello")
   for i in range(10):
        print(i)
