Commenting and Highlighting
=============================

Commenting
-----------

.. `..` is used for commenting and wont appear in the documentation process.
.. can be used forr both multiline comment and also single line comment
.. But for the multiline comment the entire section must be intended
   In this whole documentation process we use sphinx. Sphinx uses rst (restructured text ) for documenting
   In the above code we have used "=====" which will be explained in list and headers section

Highlighting
-------------

You can use ``backticks`` for showing ``highlighted`` code.
